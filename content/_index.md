## Welcome to LZ-Demo-Docs

Here you will find a set of _demonstration documentation_, that could conceivably be included in a _Landing Zone in-a-box_ package. This would give clients a head start in documenting their LZ implementation.

These demo docs include:

- A sample client's use of a GCP landing zone
- Cloud principles
- Overview of the LZ
- Design overview, resource hierarchy and key design decisions
- How to get started, onboarding, and responsibilities of the tenant
- How to get help
