Visual Studio Code is our team's standard IDE.

## Why VSCode

Choice of an IDE is a very personal thing.  If you don't like VSCode, don't use it!  That said...

- VSCode is Open Source and multi-platform
- It has Extensions for most popular languages (including Terraform, Markdown, Python), providing syntax highlighting,
linting and debugging support.
- It integrates well with git out of the box, and has extensions which improve this further (eg line-level blame highlights)
- Faster and lighter-weight than Eclipse; feels more integrated than Atom

## Alternatives

Cloud Shell provides an integrated web based IDE.  This has a history of breaking when used from within the EPAM network.

GitLab provides both single file editing and an integrated web based IDE.

EPAM has a long history of using Eclipse.

Atom is great, and infinitely customisable.

Textpad and notepad++ are available from ITSC as EPAM standard packages.

Only ever using vim will earn kudos in certain circles.
