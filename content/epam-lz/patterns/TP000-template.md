### Context

< Why do we have this pattern? What problem does it solve? What is the scope of this pattern? >

### Solution

Solution headline
{{% /notice %}}

< Description, ideally with a diagram, of the pattern. It should include preferred technology choices. It may include a decision tree, if appropriate. Include guidelines for deployment. But the pattern is not a run book, so it should avoid detailed implementation steps. >

### Rationale

< Why is this pattern appropriate? What is it preferred over other patterns that might achieve a similar result? >

### Implications

< E.g. lock-in, limitations, etc. >

### Example Use Cases

< Signpost where this pattern has already been used.  Caveat that everything is temporary. >

### Anti-Patterns

< Any patterns that nominally address the problem, but do so in a way which isnâ€™t recommended due to known issues, e.g. technical debt, cost, technology sprawl, inability to manage, etc.  Known anti-patterns are worth capturing, as this explicitly calls out solutions that should generally be avoided. >
