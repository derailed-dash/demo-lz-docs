## Decision

Define the Naming Convention for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) projects within the Google Cloud Platform for Partnership IT.

---
Our naming convention document can be found ***[here.](../../general/naming-conventions/)***

## Context

There is a need for consistency in the way we name assets across IT in the Partnership. This Naming Convention document will be a central point of knowledge for all teams involved in creating IaaS projects so that all artefacts are named in a manner easily understood by all partners across the Partnership.

### Why is a decision needed?

Create a naming standard across the Partnership for Google Cloud Platform assets that everyone will use. This will make it easier in understanding the type of asset from its name and be consistent.

### What is the problem that needs solving?

Single naming convention for everyone to use.

### Who has been involved?

GCP Platform Cloud team.

---

## Implications

As applications are migrated from an on-premises solution to a cloud based solution previously existing conventions and names will change to reflect the new naming convention.

### What are the consequences of the decision - e.g. technical debt, delays, cost, later review

This will be a living document and subject to periodic change and review to make sure it keeps up with the Partnership's changing IT requirements.
