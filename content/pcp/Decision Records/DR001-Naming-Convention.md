## Decision

Define the Naming Convention for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) projects within the Google Cloud Platform for LZ-Demo IT.

---
Our naming convention document can be found ***[here.](../../general/naming-conventions/)***

## Context

There is a need for consistency in the way we name assets across IT in the LZ-Demo. This Naming Convention document will be a central point of knowledge for all teams involved in creating IaaS projects so that all artefacts are named in a manner easily understood by all partners across the LZ-Demo.

### Why is a decision needed?

Create a naming standard across the LZ-Demo for Google Cloud Platform assets that everyone will use. This will make it easier in understanding the type of asset from its name and be consistent.

### What is the problem that needs solving?

Single naming convention for everyone to use.

### Who has been involved?

GCP Platform Cloud team.

---

## Implications

As applications are migrated from an on-premises solution to a cloud based solution previously existing conventions and names will change to reflect the new naming convention.

### What are the consequences of the decision - e.g. technical debt, delays, cost, later review

This will be a living document and subject to periodic change and review to make sure it keeps up with the LZ-Demo's changing IT requirements.
