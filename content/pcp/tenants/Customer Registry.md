## Customer Registry

**Author:** James Hoare
**Last Updated:** 05/12/2019

### Description

The Customer Registry (CuRe) will be a pan-partnership consolidated operational view of customer data built in a new Customer MDM tool from Tibco called EBX. It will link to the customer facing systems across EPAM and provide a consistent view of a customerâ€™s contact details. These are the details a customer has provided for how they want to be known through outbound targeted marketing or through interaction with our Partners/Contact Centre. This will flow downstream to be used by analytics and marketing. It will also flow upstream for transparency with the customer inline with GDPR guidelines. More details can be found in the [High Level Design.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13TCdzTNWOOlNvKyM6gs62jzFJ5NqQKxYZrT7AK3Fn-0/edit#)

There are **four** environments for Customer Registry. Environments are hosted within one of two Google Cloud Platform projects, with the split being production vs non production. The environments for Customer Registry are as follows:

| Enviornment                 | GCP Project                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Prod                        | [pit-customer-registry-prd](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=pit-customer-registry-prd) |
| Pre-Prod                    | [pit-customer-registry-npd](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=pit-customer-registry-npd) |
| Test                        | [pit-customer-registry-npd](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=pit-customer-registry-npd) |
| Sit                         | [pit-customer-registry-npd](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=pit-customer-registry-npd) |

### Resources

The Customer Registry service projects have differing infrastructure between environments (due to failover precautions in more important environments). The infrastructure components in each environment are as follows (Please note, this list excludes platform level resources present in all IaaS Projects, e.g. auto stop start functions as detailed in [DR015](../../decision-records/dr015-instance-auto-stop-start/)):

### Infrastructure as code

The Customer Registry projects are created using GitLab CI with Terraform. The repo where the code is hosted and run can be found [here.](https://gitlab.com/Lz-demo-docs/pit_platform/pit-iaas/pit-iaas-customer-registry)

The repo will contain detailed information such as how to run the CI Pipeline.

### VM Stop/Starts

Automatic VM stop/start configuration for the Customer Registry projects are as follows:

| Enviornment                 | VM Stop/Start configuration |
| --------------------------- |-----------------------------|
| Sit                         | TBC                         |
