## Hosting Summary

Here is a summary of the intended purposes of our various on-premises and cloud platforms: 

![Hosting Strategy Summary](/images/hosting-summary.png)

Consequently, the general decision making process for hosting a new solution is as follows:

- If a vendor offers a SaaS product that meets our requirements and price point, then this should be our first consideration.
- If we need to build a bespoke solution, then EDP should be our first consideration.  [EDP](https://platform.docs.jl-digital.net) is paved-road platform, optimised for building bespoke microservice-oriented applications.
- If we need to host an off-the-shelf package, or any solution that needs plain old VMs, then ECP should be your first choice.
- If our solution requires commercial hosting components with a significant license cost (e.g. Oracle Database, IBM Websphere Application Server, etc), then on-premises PSIP should be a consideration.
