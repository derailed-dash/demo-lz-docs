# pit-cloud-team-portal

This is the documentation repo for the LZ-Demo Cloud Portal.  Here you will find:

- Content for the portal site itself
- Instructions on how to modify the content
- An overview of the CI/CD pipeline that builds the site

## Site Content

The site is primarily composed of markdown (.md) files which are converted to HTML during the build step for the site. The rendering of the markdown to HTML is achieved using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).  

All site content sits under the `content` folder. Adding sub-folders under the `contents` folder will create sub-sections.  These each require an `_index.md` file for their landing page (see existing examples for inspiration). Other `.md` files in subfolders will exist as pages within the subsection. The entire content structure is therefore made up logically of folders and `.md` files.

It's recommended to look at the existing content folder and its contents and compare this to the live site for an easy understanding of how to structure your content.

For tips on how to add content and write your markdown, take a look [here](https://docs.jl-digital.net/onboarding/adding-content/).

## Site Hosting

The static site generated by the CI/CD pipeline is hosted as a Google App Engine service. See [here](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/getting-started/hosting-a-static-website) for an overview of how it works.

## Updating the site

To update the site, make changes to content in _this_ repo.  When you're happy with your changes, commit them, and create a merge request for your commit.  Once your merge has been accepted into the main branch, it will be deployed to App Engine automatically.  This deployment takes a couple of minutes to run.

## GCP Project information

The site is hosted within the [pit-shared-portal](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=pit-shared-portal&folder=&orgonly=true) project in GCP.

## Pipeline

The pipeline currently has two steps: Build and Deploy. 
  - The _Build_ step renders the website from the source, and outputs the resultant site to an artifact for the next step. 
  - The _Deploy_ step deploys an App Engine application, which points to the site content created in the _Build_ step.

Currently the app will deploy with no manual gates - once we're ready to roll the site out the CI will be updated so the traffic split is not automatically set to the new App Engine version. This will allow us to deploy the site but check the changes in the app before manually changing the traffic split to the new version upon verification that the changes are okay.

Only changes on the `master` branch are built automatically. (This is controlled by the `only: master` configuration in the CI/CD yaml.)

## Developing the Site Locally

If you are making **small ad-hoc changes**, there is no need to download this repo, and no need to run the site locally.  You can simply modify the files you want to change (e.g. using the GitLab web editor), create a commit for the changes, and then create a merge request for your commit.

However, if you are planning on making **frequent or substantial changes to this site**, it may be preferable to download this repo, and to make your changes locally before pushing back to this repo.  Why?  Because testing changes using the repo-hosted CI/CD process takes a couple of minutes.  This can be a painful delay if you're making a lot of changes. Whereas changes made locally will be visible to you instantly.

There are a couple of ways to run this site locally.

1. You can install Hugo on your machine.
1. You can run Hugo as a container.

Personally, I prefer the container approach, because we can use the Docker Compose in this repo to run a container with the same version of Hugo that the CI/CD runner uses.

Below are instructions for how to run Huge in a container locally, in order to render the site on localhost.

### Pre-Reqs

On your machine you will need:

- Docker. 
  - E.g. by installing Docker Desktop or Rancher Desktop. (On Windows, both of these require WSL.)
- Git.
  - If running this on a corporate device behind the proxy, you'll need to set proxy configuration for git: \
    git config --global http.proxy http://epam-proxy:80
- Access to this GitLab repo.

### Steps

- Clone pit-cloud-team-portal to your machine.
- Run the Docker compose, which will build and run the Hugo image from the local.Dockerfile: \
  `docker compose -f ./local.docker-compose.yml up`
- You will see Hugo start up, and the console will show the localhost URL for your site.

If you want to interactively work with the container (e.g. for debugging): \
`docker run --rm -it --entrypoint /bin/sh -v $(pwd):/src -p 1313:1313 hugo-engine:0.1`
